Start the experiment with the default values of length, mass and initial displacement (in angle). Pause the experiment after a few cycles and note the observation. 

**Observation 1:**
 1. Find the time period of the pendulum by noting the time interval of any one complete cycle from the response graph(angle vs time).
 2. You may note that this time period value is the same for any complete cycle.

**Observation 2:**
 1. Repeat the above procedure by changing the initial displacement and mass of the oscillator. 
 2. You may observe that the time period value does not change with initial displacement or even changing the mass of the oscillator. It means Time Period is independent of mass of the oscillator and also independent of initial displacement.

**Observation 3:** 
 1. Keeping the mass and initial displacement as default values, repeat the experiment by changing the length.
 2. Make note of the time interval of any one complete cycle from the response graph. You can observe that the Time Period of the simple harmonic oscillator is dependent on the length of the oscillator. 
 3. Change of time period with length can be seen in the graph present in the experiment.

**Graphs:**
 * There are various features available for the graphs such as zoom, etc. The function/feature of each icon above the graphs becomes visible upon hovering over the concerned icon.
